# ESP MQTT JSON Multisensor

This project is based on the Multisensor project by bruhAutomation
Link: https://github.com/bruhautomation/ESP-MQTT-JSON-Multisensor

### Supported Features Include
- **DHT22** temperature sensor
- **DHT22** humidity sensor
- **AM312** PIR motion sensor 
- **photoresistor** or **TEMT600** light sensor
- **RGB led** with support for color, flash, fade, and transition
- **Over-the-Air (OTA)** upload from the ArudioIDE
- **Wifi configuration** using a temporary access point



#### OTA Uploading
This code also supports remote uploading to the ESP8266 using Arduino's OTA library. To utilize this, you'll need to first upload the sketch using the traditional USB method. However, if you need to update your code after that, your WIFI-connected ESP chip should show up as an option under Tools -> Port -> Porch at your.ip.address.xxx. More information on OTA uploading can be found [here](http://esp8266.github.io/Arduino/versions/2.0.0/doc/ota_updates/ota_updates.html). Note: You cannot access the serial monitor over WIFI at this point.

### 3D Printed Enclosure
In an effort to make the sensor less ugly, I designed an enclosure in 123D Design and uploaded the [STL file](https://github.com/bruhautomation/ESP-MQTT-JSON-Multisensor/blob/master/BRUH%20Multisensor%20V1.stl) in case you want to print your own. It's also availible on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2239142). I printed mine on a [Prusa I3 clone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLRdMtZVQfQ) with a layer height of 0.2 mm, 40% infill, and no supports in [ESUN PLA](http://geni.us/GS3U) and it turned out great. 

Alternatively, you can also make your own enclosure by hand using something like [Instamorph](http://geni.us/BtidLG3). It's themoplastic that melts in hot water and then solidifies to hard plastic at room temperature. You can even get [pigment packs](http://geni.us/dNTi) and take it next level. I, personally, suck at using it, but it's cheap and functional. 

Of course, you can use a project box, tupperware, a card board box, or skip the enclosure all together.

### UPDATED 10 JUN 2017
I added a second version of my enclosure that moves the DHT22 sensor outside the case, removes the standoff for the LDR sensor, and adds a pocket for the LED. This should reduce most of the high temperatures being reported by the board and the removal of the standoff allows you to use either the TEMT600 sensor or photoresistor module. A dab of hot glue can help hold everything in place until you can snap the case together.

A few people have reported that the floating PIR sensor issue is back. If it happens, wrap the PIR module in electrical tape, then aluminum foil, and then electrical tape again. Using the tape will make sure you don't short anything out with the foil on either the module or other components in the system.



### Home Assistant Service Examples
Besides using the card in Home Assistant's user interface, you can also use the Services tool to control the light using the light.turn_on and light.turn_off services. This will let you play with the parameters you can call later in automations or scripts. 

Fade the Light On Over 5 Seconds - light.turn_on
```
{"entity_id":"light.sn1_led",
"brightness":150,
"color_name":"blue",
"transition":"5"
}
```

Flash The Light - light.turn_on
```
{"entity_id":"light.sn1_led",
"color_name":"green",
"brightness":255,
"flash":"short"
}
```

Fade the Light Off Over 5 Seconds - light.turn_off
```
{"entity_id":"light.sn1_led",
"transition":"5"
}
```
